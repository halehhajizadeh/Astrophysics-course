>2.1. Make a fourth column for Table 2.1, showing the range of photon frequencies for each part of the spectrum. Make a fifth column showing the range
of photon energies for each part of the spectrum. Make a sixth column showing the temperatures
that blackbodies would have to peak at the wavelengths corresponding to the boundaries between the parts of the spectrum.


>2.4. For the Sun, calculate the energy given off over the wavelength bands that correspond to the U, B and V filters. Use this to estimate the colors U-B and B-V.
