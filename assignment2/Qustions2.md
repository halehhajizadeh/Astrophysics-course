>3.6. If we are limited to m = 6 or brighter for making naked eye observations, make a table of the maximum distance we can see a star for the mid-range of each spectral type (O5, B5, etc) for main sequence stars.

>3.7. For the mid-range tmperature for each spectral type, draw a graph of log B(&lambda;, T) vs. &lambda; for wavelengths ranging from IR to UV.

>3.8. For the mid-range temperature for each spectral type, find the number of H ionizing photons emitted per second.
